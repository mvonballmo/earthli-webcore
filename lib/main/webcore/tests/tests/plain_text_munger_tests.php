\r
<dl dt_class=\"field\">\r
Al Qaeda\r
Apparently, the war on terror is going unbelievably well: it's a catastrophic success. Bush noted in the second debate that <iq>we're bringing Al Qaida to justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.</iq> Where, pray tell, does that number come from? Does anyone even care anymore when Bush pulls a number out of his ass? How do we know how many people are in Al Qaeda? How do we even know if it exists, per se? Doesn't matter, we've caught 75% and by the end of his next 4 years, we'll have easily cleaned up the rest. Then we can all celebrate in a world without evil.\r
The Taliban\r
In Bush's fairy-tale world, the Taliban also no longer exist. Because we vanquished them. In the real world, they didn't stay vanquished for long, although they have had to cede power to the warlords throughout most of Afghanistan, where the drug trade has increased by approximately 400 million percent.\r
Afghanistan\r
<div>\r
This is a picture-perfect example of a country that benefitted from the freedom that America oozes from it's pores as it strides through the benighted world, bestowing freedom and compassion with a kind paternal hand. Bush touted their recent elections as an astounding success; <a href=\"http://www.registerguard.com/news/2004/10/19/ed.edit.afghanistan.phn.1019.html\" title=\"Afghanistan's election: U.S., allies must fulfill long-term commitment\">Afghanistan's election</a> gives a brief run-down of the country's situation:\r
\r
<bq>warlords have gained power in ... provinces where their private militias hold sway. The opium trade, once quashed under the Taliban, has been revived on a massive scale. Violence has driven <b>most nonprofit organizations from the countryside</b>. Health experts warn that 70 percent of Afghan people are malnourished; only 13 percent have access to potable water and sanitation. (emphasis added)</bq>\r
\r
Hold on a minute. <i>Doctors without borders</i> has bailed on the country as too dangerous, but their elections are more than just an idle gesture? How can that be? So the people of Afghanistan (those than aren't too starved to even get to a polling station, which would be 30% of them) voted for the president of Kabul (<iq>outside of Kabul, where 80 percent of Afghans live ... Karzai's control is tenuous or nonexistent</iq>)? Wow ... massive progress. A resounding blow for freedom. All signs indicate that the timing of this election once again, suspiciously, benefits Bush, as the article also notes that a lot of work needs to be done to make sure that <iq>this election is not to be Afghanistan's last</iq>. \r
</div>\r
Diplomacy\r
During the second debate, Bush defended his record as a war president, declaring that <iq>obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.</iq> That statement alone proves there is no God, else he would have been struck dead by 10,000 simultaneous lightning blasts. Later he said that <iq>I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.</iq> Just showing up in a building is not diplomacy, jackass. That's called lip service. Just like coming up with new, ever more fantastical reasons to attack Iraq each time one is shot down doesn't count as \"trying to avoid a war\".\r
Weapons of Mass Destruction\r
<div>\r
The recently-issued Duelfer report about WMDs is huge. Almost everyone who reads it or heard his testimony sees overwhelming proof that the sanctions worked and that, after 1995, Saddam had no WMDs left. The fact that, in the last 20 months, no weapons have been found, is also somewhat damning to the Bush administration's justifications for war.\r
\r
Bush to the rescue! He goes the extra mile and notes only that Saddam (who is an evil bastard, we all agree), wasn't playing nice with the UN sanctions. In fact, he was <iq>gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions ... [because] ... [h]e wanted to restart his weapons programs</iq>. For Bush, <iq>[t]hat's what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors.</iq>\r
\r
Period. That's it. There are no other conclusions to draw from the report except that Bush was right all along. Of course, Saddam didn't have any weapons, nor any means to procure them. However, since the sanctions (which neither candidate condemns for the human-rights disaster it was) didn't magically turn Saddam into a nice guy, they obviously weren't enough. See? You see how it was right to go to Iraq? When you look at 7 words out of a 10000 page document and ignore all other physical evidence? You see how a powerful faith can truly move mountains?\r
</div>\r
Election in Iraq\r
These will happen in January and they will mean something. The shining example of Afghanistan will lead Iraq out of the darkness.\r
Coalition of the Willing\r
<div>\r
Look ... the name itself is completely uninspiring. Remember how disgusted Bush was that Kerry <iq>forgot Poland</iq>? Too bad Bush wasted all of that time learning how to pronounce Aleksander Kwasniewski because they have in the meantime also withdrawn their troops. Bush will tell you all day long that the coalition is composed of dozens of strong countries. Kerry nailed him to the wall with these beauties though: <iq>Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining. Eight countries have left it.</iq> and this one was just priceless:\r
\r
<bq>If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.</bq>\r
\r
Ouch! Naturally, Bush's version of reality survived intact.\r
</div>\r
Missile Defense Shield\r
<div>\r
And finally, a fantasy that many other presidents and candidates also slobber on about. Here's where Bush doesn't even attempt to technically justify the shield -- he just notes that his opponent is opposed to it and smirks. This, for a seemingly impossibly consistent 45% of America, is enough proof that the program is good. Never mind that there is no way it will ever work; never mind that Reagan, one of the century's leading thinkers, hatched this hare-brained idea; never mind that only scientists on a Rebulican think-tank's payroll will offer any comment other than gut-laughing. never mind that it's obvious pandering to his strongest corporate supporters: the military-industrial complex.\r
\r
Kerry, believe it or not, is opposed to it and plans to shut the program down (if possible, I might add ... it might be too much a part of the budget culture by now). There are rumors that work is underway to provide a several-missile deployment in California as \"proof\" that Kim Jong Il is not a threat. Two birds with one subterfuge would be quite a feather in its cap for this administration.\r

</ol>\r
\r
</div>\r
Diplomacy\r
During the second debate, Bush defended his record as a war president, declaring that <iq>obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.</iq> That statement alone proves there is no God, else he would have been struck dead by 10,000 simultaneous lightning blasts. Later he said that <iq>I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.</iq> Just showing up in a building is not diplomacy, jackass. That's called lip service. Just like coming up with new, ever more fantastical reasons to attack Iraq each time one is shot down doesn't count as \"trying to avoid a war\".\r
Weapons of Mass Destruction\r
<div>\r
The recently-issued Duelfer report about WMDs is huge. Almost everyone who reads it or heard his testimony sees overwhelming proof that the sanctions worked and that, after 1995, Saddam had no WMDs left. The fact that, in the last 20 months, no weapons have been found, is also somewhat damning to the Bush administration's justifications for war.\r
\r
Bush to the rescue! He goes the extra mile and notes only that Saddam (who is an evil bastard, we all agree), wasn't playing nice with the UN sanctions. In fact, he was <iq>gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions ... [because] ... [h]e wanted to restart his weapons programs</iq>. For Bush, <iq>[t]hat's what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors.</iq>\r
\r
Period. That's it. There are no other conclusions to draw from the report except that Bush was right all along. Of course, Saddam didn't have any weapons, nor any means to procure them. However, since the sanctions (which neither candidate condemns for the human-rights disaster it was) didn't magically turn Saddam into a nice guy, they obviously weren't enough. See? You see how it was right to go to Iraq? When you look at 7 words out of a 10000 page document and ignore all other physical evidence? You see how a powerful faith can truly move mountains?\r
</div>\r
Election in Iraq\r
These will happen in January and they will mean something. The shining example of Afghanistan will lead Iraq out of the darkness.\r
Coalition of the Willing\r
<div>\r
Look ... the name itself is completely uninspiring. Remember how disgusted Bush was that Kerry <iq>forgot Poland</iq>? Too bad Bush wasted all of that time learning how to pronounce Aleksander Kwasniewski because they have in the meantime also withdrawn their troops. Bush will tell you all day long that the coalition is composed of dozens of strong countries. Kerry nailed him to the wall with these beauties though: <iq>Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining. Eight countries have left it.</iq> and this one was just priceless:\r
\r
<bq>If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.</bq>\r
\r
Ouch! Naturally, Bush's version of reality survived intact.\r
</div>\r
Missile Defense Shield\r
<div>\r
And finally, a fantasy that many other presidents and candidates also slobber on about. Here's where Bush doesn't even attempt to technically justify the shield -- he just notes that his opponent is opposed to it and smirks. This, for a seemingly impossibly consistent 45% of America, is enough proof that the program is good. Never mind that there is no way it will ever work; never mind that Reagan, one of the century's leading thinkers, hatched this hare-brained idea; never mind that only scientists on a Rebulican think-tank's payroll will offer any comment other than gut-laughing. never mind that it's obvious pandering to his strongest corporate supporters: the military-industrial complex.\r
\r
Kerry, believe it or not, is opposed to it and plans to shut the program down (if possible, I might add ... it might be too much a part of the budget culture by now). There are rumors that work is underway to provide a several-missile deployment in California as \"proof\" that Kim Jong Il is not a threat. Two birds with one subterfuge would be quite a feather in its cap for this administration.\r

      fact, he welcomes us all to join him in his fervent worship of a
      simplistic black-and-white world where saying something makes it true. A
      few examples:

Al Qaeda

   Apparently, the war on terror is going unbelievably well: it's a catastrophic
   success. Bush noted in the second debate that \"we're bringing Al Qaida to
   justice. Seventy five percent of them have been brought to justice.\" Where,
   pray tell, does that number come from? Does anyone even care anymore when
   Bush pulls a number out of his ass? How do we know how many people are in Al
   Qaeda? How do we even know if it exists, per se? Doesn't matter, we've caught
   75% and by the end of his next 4 years, we'll have easily cleaned up the
   rest. Then we can all celebrate in a world without evil.

The Taliban

   In Bush's fairy-tale world, the Taliban also no longer exist. Because we
   vanquished them. In the real world, they didn't stay vanquished for long,
   although they have had to cede power to the warlords throughout most of
   Afghanistan, where the drug trade has increased by approximately 400 million
   percent.

Afghanistan

   This is a picture-perfect example of a country that benefitted from the
   freedom that America oozes from it's pores as it strides through the
   benighted world, bestowing freedom and compassion with a kind paternal hand.
   Bush touted their recent elections as an astounding success; \"Afghanistan's
   election\"
   <http://www.registerguard.com/news/2004/10/19/ed.edit.afghanistan.phn.1019.html>
   (Afghanistan's election: U.S., allies must fulfill long-term commitment)
   gives a brief run-down of the country's situation:
   
   \"warlords have gained power in ... provinces where their private militias
   hold sway. The opium trade, once quashed under the Taliban, has been revived
   on a massive scale. Violence has driven most nonprofit organizations from the
   countryside. Health experts warn that 70 percent of Afghan people are
   malnourished; only 13 percent have access to potable water and sanitation.
   (emphasis added)\"
   
   Hold on a minute. Doctors without borders has bailed on the country as too
   dangerous, but their elections are more than just an idle gesture? How can
   that be? So the people of Afghanistan (those than aren't too starved to even
   get to a polling station, which would be 30% of them) voted for the president
   of Kabul (\"outside of Kabul, where 80 percent of Afghans live ... Karzai's
   control is tenuous or nonexistent\")? Wow ... massive progress. A resounding
   blow for freedom. All signs indicate that the timing of this election once
   again, suspiciously, benefits Bush, as the article also notes that a lot of
   work needs to be done to make sure that \"this election is not to be
   Afghanistan's last\". 
   
   
      1. Bush is clearly not living in the world we live in. He doesn't lie;
         it's just that, when he talks, he's not describing the world we live
         in.

       living wage for all jobs and wants to raise the minimum wage. Seems to
       support prosecuting companies that hire illegals rather than the illegals
       themselves.
     * Bush thinks that a job is a job, regardless of how much it pays; also
       thinks that migrant workers should be allowed to do jobs that \"no
       American wants to do\". Is happy with the market regulating pay levels,
       even if that doesn't result in a living wage. He \"will talk about the 1.7
       million jobs created since the summer of 2003, and will say that the
       economy is \"strong and getting stronger.\" That's like boasting about
       getting a D on your final exam, when you flunked the midterm and needed
       at least a C to pass the course.\" (\"Checking the Facts, in Advance\" by
       Paul Krugman <http://pkarchive.org/column/101204.html>)

Social Security

     * Kerry thinks we should leave it alone and stop thinking up ways to
       plunder it
     * Bush thinks that young people (teens on up) should be able to invest that
       money in the stock market instead. They are far more likely to invest it
       in an iPod or 20\" rims.

Definition of work

     * Kerry, several times, in fact, mentioned that he wants programs to have
       enough money to get their job done
     * Bush is happy to call an increase an improvement, no matter what. (Pell
       grants here are an example -- Bush's administration saw one million more
       of them distributed, but each grant is, on average only half of what it
       was four years ago)

The Military

     * Kerry thinks we're overextended, but also thinks we should have sent
       more. Thinks we should increase the military by 40,000 people. Perhaps
       it's jobs program?
     * Bush says there will not be a draft, because everything is hunky dorey.

Religion

     * Kerry bases his entire life around religion and his faith (\"My faith
       affects everything that I do, in truth. ... I think that everything you
       do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your
       faith...\")
     * Bush bases his entire life around religion and his faith (\"First, my
       faith plays a lot -- a big part in my life. And that's, when I was
       answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that
       I pray a lot. And I do.\")

[Kerry Quotes]

\"But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists
change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our
rights.\"

\"Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like
Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.\"

[Conclusions]

Kerry is

  * a politician, through and through. He stands for something if it doesn't get
    in the way of his career
  * not going to fix a lot of things that are wrong with America, but has the
    taken the big step of admitting that there are things wrong with America
  * Talks a lot about war; will stay in Iraq; will hold the course in Israel
  * Also talks a lot about domestic programs and actually addresses problems in
    a meaningful and halfway-honest way (for a politician)

Bush is

  * Petulant, whiny, defensive, occasionally hostile; seems to beg you to agree
    with him
  * Self-contradicting:
     1. He says we can't get cheaper meds from Canada (as he promised four years
        ago) because they \"might not be safe\". When asked what he's going to do
        about the shortage of flu vaccine, he suggests Canada as our last hope.
     2. Does everything possible to protect a baby before it's born; does
        everything possible to prevent paying for a single thing once it takes
        its first breath.
  * Is too stupid to even realize that the \"you can run, but you can't hide\"
    slogan backfires horribly because the first guy he applied it to, Osama Bin
    Laden, is still hiding quite nicely.
  * Seems to be for the Dred Scott decision, which disallowed citizen's rights
    to any black person, regardless of slave/free status. Is too stupid to
    realize that he's too stupid to talk about history in any depth or
    meaningful way.
  * If he's forced to admit that something's not optimal, he claims he
    \"inherited it\" from Clinton.
