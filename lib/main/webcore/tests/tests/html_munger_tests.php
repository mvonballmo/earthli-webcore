A few examples:\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n</div>\r\nDiplomacy\r\nDuring the second debate, Bush defended his record as a war president, declaring that <iq>obviously we hope that diplomacy works before you ever use force. The hardest decision a president makes is ever to use force.</iq> That statement alone proves there is no God, else he would have been struck dead by 10,000 simultaneous lightning blasts. Later he said that <iq>I tried diplomacy, went to the United Nations.</iq> Just showing up in a building is not diplomacy, jackass. That's called lip service. Just like coming up with new, ever more fantastical reasons to attack Iraq each time one is shot down doesn't count as \"trying to avoid a war\".\r\nWeapons of Mass Destruction\r\n<div>\r\nThe recently-issued Duelfer report about WMDs is huge. Almost everyone who reads it or heard his testimony sees overwhelming proof that the sanctions worked and that, after 1995, Saddam had no WMDs left. The fact that, in the last 20 months, no weapons have been found, is also somewhat damning to the Bush administration's justifications for war.\r\n\r\nBush to the rescue! He goes the extra mile and notes only that Saddam (who is an evil bastard, we all agree), wasn't playing nice with the UN sanctions. In fact, he was <iq>gaming the oil-for-food program to get rid of sanctions ... [because] ... [h]e wanted to restart his weapons programs</iq>. For Bush, <iq>[t]hat's what the Duelfer report showed. He was deceiving the inspectors.</iq>\r\n\r\nPeriod. That's it. There are no other conclusions to draw from the report except that Bush was right all along. Of course, Saddam didn't have any weapons, nor any means to procure them. However, since the sanctions (which neither candidate condemns for the human-rights disaster it was) didn't magically turn Saddam into a nice guy, they obviously weren't enough. See? You see how it was right to go to Iraq? When you look at 7 words out of a 10000 page document and ignore all other physical evidence? You see how a powerful faith can truly move mountains?\r\n</div>\r\nElection in Iraq\r\nThese will happen in January and they will mean something. The shining example of Afghanistan will lead Iraq out of the darkness.\r\nCoalition of the Willing\r\n<div>\r\nLook ... the name itself is completely uninspiring. Remember how disgusted Bush was that Kerry <iq>forgot Poland</iq>? Too bad Bush wasted all of that time learning how to pronounce Aleksander Kwasniewski because they have in the meantime also withdrawn their troops. Bush will tell you all day long that the coalition is composed of dozens of strong countries. Kerry nailed him to the wall with these beauties though: <iq>Mr. President, countries are leaving the coalition, not joining. Eight countries have left it.</iq> and this one was just priceless:\r\n\r\n<bq>If Missouri, just given the number of people from Missouri who are in the military over there today, were a country, it would be the third largest country in the coalition, behind Great Britain and the United States.</bq>\r\n\r\nOuch! Naturally, Bush's version of reality survived intact.\r\n</div>\r\nMissile Defense Shield\r\n<div>\r\nAnd finally, a fantasy that many other presidents and candidates also slobber on about. Here's where Bush doesn't even attempt to technically justify the shield -- he just notes that his opponent is opposed to it and smirks. This, for a seemingly impossibly consistent 45% of America, is enough proof that the program is good. Never mind that there is no way it will ever work; never mind that Reagan, one of the century's leading thinkers, hatched this hare-brained idea; never mind that only scientists on a Rebulican think-tank's payroll will offer any comment other than gut-laughing. never mind that it's obvious pandering to his strongest corporate supporters: the military-industrial complex.\r\n\r\nKerry, believe it or not, is opposed to it and plans to shut the program down (if possible, I might add ... it might be too much a part of the budget culture by now). There are rumors that work is underway to provide a several-missile deployment in California as \"proof\" that Kim Jong Il is not a threat. Two birds with one subterfuge would be quite a feather in its cap for this administration.\r\n</div>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\nBush is clearly not living in the world we live in.

He also says it needs to be pretty much massively rewritten, but he doesn't have the gonads to say it's a piece of crap, because that offends too many of the wrong people.\r\nBush doesn't think the Patriot Act has affected citizen's rights\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Internet(s)\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry mentioned his web site several times and directed people there for more information\r\nBush talks about <iq>the Internets</iq>. WTF? Has he ever even used a computer?\r\n</ul>\r\nGay marriage\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry doesn't support gay marriage, but supports partnerships, whatever that means. We already have a legal definition for when people want to spend their lives together: why do you need to make another one?\r\nBush supports gay marriage if it's <iq>between a man and a woman</iq>.\r\n</ul>\r\nRonald Reagan\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry loves him. (WTF is up with that?)\r\nBush probably loves him even more\r\n</ul>\r\nFaith-based programs\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry believes in them strongly and will support and increase them\r\nBush invented the damned things and would like to funnel all federal dollars into them, so you need to take a Jesus loyaltly oath to get a piece of bread in a soup kitchen.\r\n</ul>\r\nAbortion\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry spent several minutes talking about abortion without ever (not once) actually saying the word. He seems to probably support a woman's right to choose, but he's so heavily politicized, it's kind of hard to tell.\r\nBush thinks abortion should be outlawed, but will settle for making abortion so difficult, socially sitgmatizing and painful that no one gets them anymore. Rues every dollar of federal money spent on any program that ever uttered the word abortion.\r\n</ul>\r\n9/11\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry thinks this is a reason for <iq>hunting and killing terrorists</iq>\r\nBush thinks this is a reason for everything.\r\n</ul>\r\nTerrorists\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry thinks that terrorists are mindless, soul-eating machines, born to kill without reason and with an undying and unexplainable hatred of America. He thinks we should protect our borders and industrial centers better.\r\nBush thinks that terrorists are mindless, soul-eating machines, born to kill without reason and with an undying and unexplainable hatred of America. He thinks we should <iq>stay on the offensive</iq> ('cause that's worked out great so far)\r\n</ul>\r\nChanging his mind\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry seems to alter his opinions when the facts have changed\r\nBush never, ever, ever reconsiders anything\r\n</ul>\r\nHealth Care\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry sees this as the country's greatest failure, pointing out that every other first world country has a system\r\nBush doesn't care how those other pansies are doing it and thinks the current system works just fine\r\n</ul>\r\nJobs\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry thinks we need to stop tax incentives that encourage American firms from hiring outside of the US. Thinks companies should have to pay a living wage for all jobs and wants to raise the minimum wage. Seems to support prosecuting companies that hire illegals rather than the illegals themselves.\r\nBush thinks that a job is a job, regardless of how much it pays; also thinks that migrant workers should be allowed to do jobs that <iq>no American wants to do</iq>. Is happy with the market regulating pay levels, even if that doesn't result in a living wage. He <iq>will talk about the 1.7 million jobs created since the summer of 2003, and will say that the economy is \"strong and getting stronger.\" That's like boasting about getting a D on your final exam, when you flunked the midterm and needed at least a C to pass the course.</iq> (<a href=\"http://pkarchive.org/column/101204.html\" author=\"Paul Krugman\">Checking the Facts, in Advance</a>)\r\n</ul>\r\nSocial Security\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry thinks we should leave it alone and stop thinking up ways to plunder it\r\nBush thinks that young people (teens on up) should be able to invest that money in the stock market instead. They are far more likely to invest it in an iPod or 20\" rims.\r\n</ul>\r\nDefinition of work\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry, several times, in fact, mentioned that he wants programs to have enough money to get their job done\r\nBush is happy to call an increase an improvement, no matter what. (Pell grants here are an example & Bush's administration saw one million more of them distributed, but each grant is, on average only half of what it was four years ago)\r\n</ul>\r\nThe Military\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry thinks we're overextended, but also thinks we should have sent more. Thinks we should increase the military by 40,000 people. Perhaps it's jobs program?\r\nBush says there will not be a draft, because everything is hunky dorey.\r\n</ul>\r\nReligion\r\n<ul>\r\nKerry bases his entire life around religion and his faith (<iq>My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. ... I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith...</iq>)\r\nBush bases his entire life around religion and his faith (<iq>First, my faith plays a lot -- a big part in my life. And that's, when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot. And I do.</iq>)\r\n</ul>\r\n</dl>\r\n\r\n<h>Kerry Quotes</h>\r\n\r\n<bq>But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.</bq>\r\n\r\n<bq>Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.</bq>\r\n\r\n<h>Conclusions</h>\r\n\r\nKerry is\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\na politician, through and through. He stands for something if it doesn't get in the way of his career\r\nnot going to fix a lot of things that are wrong with America, but has the taken the big step of admitting that there are things wrong with America\r\nTalks a lot about war; will stay in Iraq; will hold the course in Israel\r\nAlso talks a lot about domestic programs and actually addresses problems in a meaningful and halfway-honest way (for a politician)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nBush is\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\nPetulant, whiny, defensive, occasionally hostile; seems to beg you to agree with him\r\nSelf-contradicting:\r\n<ol>\r\nHe says we can't get cheaper meds from Canada (as he promised four years ago) because they <iq>might not be safe</iq>. When asked what he's going to do about the shortage of flu vaccine, he suggests Canada as our last hope.\r\nDoes everything possible to protect a baby before it's born; does everything possible to prevent paying for a single thing once it takes its first breath.\r\n</ol>\r\nIs too stupid to even realize that the <iq>you can run, but you can't hide</iq> slogan backfires horribly because the first guy he applied it to, Osama Bin Laden, is still hiding quite nicely.\r\nSeems to be <i>for</i> the Dred Scott decision, which disallowed citizen's rights to any black person, regardless of slave/free status.

Unattributed quotes below are straight from the transcripts, found at <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2004c.html\">Debate #2</a> (&#8220;Rage in the Cage&#8221;) and <a href=\"http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2004d.html\">Debate #3</a> (&#8220;Bloodmatch &#8211; back for more Blood&#8221;).</p>\n<h3>Head to Head</h3><dl><dt class=\"field\">Patriot Act</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry says he supports the Patriot Act. He also says it needs to be pretty much massively rewritten, but he doesn&#8217;t have the gonads to say it&#8217;s a piece of crap, because that offends too many of the wrong people.</li>\n<li>Bush doesn&#8217;t think the Patriot Act has affected citizen&#8217;s rights</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">The Internet(s)</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry mentioned his web site several times and directed people there for more information</li>\n<li>Bush talks about <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;the Internets&#8221;</span>. WTF? Has he ever even used a computer?</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Gay marriage</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry doesn&#8217;t support gay marriage, but supports partnerships, whatever that means. We already have a legal definition for when people want to spend their lives together: why do you need to make another one?</li>\n<li>Bush supports gay marriage if it&#8217;s <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;between a man and a woman&#8221;</span>.</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Ronald Reagan</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry loves him. (WTF is up with that?)</li>\n<li>Bush probably loves him even more</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Faith-based programs</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry believes in them strongly and will support and increase them</li>\n<li>Bush invented the damned things and would like to funnel all federal dollars into them, so you need to take a Jesus loyaltly oath to get a piece of bread in a soup kitchen.</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Abortion</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry spent several minutes talking about abortion without ever (not once) actually saying the word. He seems to probably support a woman&#8217;s right to choose, but he&#8217;s so heavily politicized, it&#8217;s kind of hard to tell.</li>\n<li>Bush thinks abortion should be outlawed, but will settle for making abortion so difficult, socially sitgmatizing and painful that no one gets them anymore. Rues every dollar of federal money spent on any program that ever uttered the word abortion.</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">9/11</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry thinks this is a reason for <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;hunting and killing terrorists&#8221;</span></li>\n<li>Bush thinks this is a reason for everything.</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Terrorists</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry thinks that terrorists are mindless, soul-eating machines, born to kill without reason and with an undying and unexplainable hatred of America. He thinks we should protect our borders and industrial centers better.</li>\n<li>Bush thinks that terrorists are mindless, soul-eating machines, born to kill without reason and with an undying and unexplainable hatred of America. He thinks we should <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;stay on the offensive&#8221;</span> (&#8216;cause that&#8217;s worked out great so far)</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Changing his mind</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry seems to alter his opinions when the facts have changed</li>\n<li>Bush never, ever, ever reconsiders anything</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Health Care</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry sees this as the country&#8217;s greatest failure, pointing out that every other first world country has a system</li>\n<li>Bush doesn&#8217;t care how those other pansies are doing it and thinks the current system works just fine</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Jobs</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry thinks we need to stop tax incentives that encourage American firms from hiring outside of the US. Thinks companies should have to pay a living wage for all jobs and wants to raise the minimum wage. Seems to support prosecuting companies that hire illegals rather than the illegals themselves.</li>\n<li>Bush thinks that a job is a job, regardless of how much it pays; also thinks that migrant workers should be allowed to do jobs that <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;no American wants to do&#8221;</span>. Is happy with the market regulating pay levels, even if that doesn&#8217;t result in a living wage. He <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;will talk about the 1.7 million jobs created since the summer of 2003, and will say that the economy is &#8220;strong and getting stronger.&#8221; That&#8217;s like boasting about getting a D on your final exam, when you flunked the midterm and needed at least a C to pass the course.&#8221;</span> (<a href=\"http://pkarchive.org/column/101204.html\">Checking the Facts, in Advance</a> by <cite>Paul Krugman</cite>)</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Social Security</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry thinks we should leave it alone and stop thinking up ways to plunder it</li>\n<li>Bush thinks that young people (teens on up) should be able to invest that money in the stock market instead. They are far more likely to invest it in an iPod or 20\" rims.</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Definition of work</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry, several times, in fact, mentioned that he wants programs to have enough money to get their job done</li>\n<li>Bush is happy to call an increase an improvement, no matter what. (Pell grants here are an example &amp; Bush&#8217;s administration saw one million more of them distributed, but each grant is, on average only half of what it was four years ago)</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">The Military</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry thinks we&#8217;re overextended, but also thinks we should have sent more. Thinks we should increase the military by 40,000 people. Perhaps it&#8217;s jobs program?</li>\n<li>Bush says there will not be a draft, because everything is hunky dorey.</li></ul></dd>\n<dt class=\"field\">Religion</dt>\n<dd><ul>\n<li>Kerry bases his entire life around religion and his faith (<span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;My faith affects everything that I do, in truth. &#8230; I think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith, affected by your faith&#8230;&#8221;</span>)</li>\n<li>Bush bases his entire life around religion and his faith (<span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;First, my faith plays a lot &#8211; a big part in my life. And that&#8217;s, when I was answering that question, what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot. And I do.&#8221;</span>)</li></ul></dd>\n</dl><h3>Kerry Quotes</h3><div class=\"quote quote-block\">&#8220;But you know what we also need to do as Americans is never let the terrorists change the Constitution of the United States in a way that disadvantages our rights.&#8221;</div><div class=\"quote quote-block\">&#8220;Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country.&#8221;</div><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>Kerry is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a politician, through and through. He stands for something if it doesn&#8217;t get in the way of his career</li>\n<li>not going to fix a lot of things that are wrong with America, but has the taken the big step of admitting that there are things wrong with America</li>\n<li>Talks a lot about war; will stay in Iraq; will hold the course in Israel</li>\n<li>Also talks a lot about domestic programs and actually addresses problems in a meaningful and halfway-honest way (for a politician)</li></ul><p>Bush is</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Petulant, whiny, defensive, occasionally hostile; seems to beg you to agree with him</li>\n<li><div>Self-contradicting:<ol>\n<li>He says we can&#8217;t get cheaper meds from Canada (as he promised four years ago) because they <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;might not be safe&#8221;</span>. When asked what he&#8217;s going to do about the shortage of flu vaccine, he suggests Canada as our last hope.</li>\n<li>Does everything possible to protect a baby before it&#8217;s born; does everything possible to prevent paying for a single thing once it takes its first breath.</li></ol></div></li>\n<li>Is too stupid to even realize that the <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;you can run, but you can&#8217;t hide&#8221;</span> slogan backfires horribly because the first guy he applied it to, Osama Bin Laden, is still hiding quite nicely.</li>\n<li>Seems to be <em>for</em> the Dred Scott decision, which disallowed citizen&#8217;s rights to any black person, regardless of slave/free status. Is too stupid to realize that he&#8217;s too stupid to talk about history in any depth or meaningful way.</li>\n<li>If he&#8217;s forced to admit that something&#8217;s <em>not optimal</em>, he claims he <span class=\"quote-inline\">&#8220;inherited it&#8221;</span> from Clinton.</li></ul>"
