<h3>Accomodations</h3>
<p>If you're coming to the reception from far away, you will most likely need accomodations for
	Saturday night. Here are the known hotels, inns and motels from closest to farthest away from
	the castle. The places are all West of the castle, so if you're coming from the East (New York,
	Boston etc.), you will have to drive a little farther.</p>
	<p>These places came as recommendations
	from the Beardslee Castle itself. Of the places below, the Best Western and Red Carpet Inn will
	have the most predictable experience, and the most reasonable prices, but the others may be
	quite nice bed and breakfasts for a weekend upstate.</p>
