<h3>R.S.V.P.</h3>
<p>Here's where you can quickly and easily R.S.V.P. for the wedding. You can also either:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>browse the <a href="index.php?panel=guest_list">guest list</a> (You can also see who else is coming)</li>
		<li><a href="index.php?panel=guest_search">search</a> for your name using first name, last name or nicknames.</li>
	</ol>
<p>You can easily change your registration if you change your mind, but after August 21, 2002 we reserve the right
	to "freeze" the guest list. An announcement will be made here and the updating function will be turned off.</p>
<p class="notes">Yes, we're aware that there's no security on this site and you can change anyone's R.S.V.P.
	settings. Yes, it's a lot of fun to hack web sites. There are no passwords because that would be a hassle for
	everyone registering. Please behave yourselves and don't mess up our guest list. Thanks.
