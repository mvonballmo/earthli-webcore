<h3>Gift Policy</h3>
<p>As mentioned on the home page, Kath and Marco are moving to Switzerland in as little as two weeks
	after the wedding. This necessarily introduces complications in the traditional wedding gift
	policy for two main reasons:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Everything we get has to be packed. We already have <em>way</em> too much stuff of our
		own to pack.</li>
	<li>Many traditional wedding presents have plugs that don't fit in Switzerland (they use 220V).</li>
</ol>
<p>First and foremost, we'd appreciate your company at the reception. If you want to
	give us a gift, then a cash gift would be the most useful and practical gift you could give. It
	would help us furnish our new place in Switzerland without the hassle of shipping.</p>
<p>Thanks for understanding.</p>
