<p class="notes">*We've chosen the german word for wedding for this site's name for two reasons. First,
	we're moving to Switzerland soon after the wedding. Second, the literal translation is "high time",
	which is a nice pun for how most would describe this wedding, as in "it's high time they're getting
	married." Hope we didn't lose too many of you there.</p>
